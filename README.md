# Student Choice Labs

Developers have a choice between two topics in React. Pick one of the
two topics listed below and spend the lab period learning about that topic.

## Prerequisites

- React and Components.
- Working with State and Props.

## Instructions

1. Pick one of the two topics listed below.
1. Work through the lesson on that topic, completing all the exercises.

You'll pick one of the two topics listed below and spend time learning it.

## Topics

### 1. [Build a React Giphy Searcher with React Hooks](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-129/react-giphy-searcher)
This is a code-along exercise for building a Giphy search app in React using React Hooks. This tutorial will walk you through all the steps needed to build [this application](https://react-giphy-searcher.herokuapp.com/). This is a good exercise to prepare you for project 2.

### 2. [Redux]( https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-129/react-redux)

Redux is a state management solution for React. Rather than manage your state
inside your react compeonts, you'll manage it all within Redux. If you have a
lot of state (i.e. your app is fairly large) or your state is complicated, Redux
provides strict guidelines and a simple interface that alleviates the pain of
managing state.
